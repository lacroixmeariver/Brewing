# Brewing 

A simulation/role-playing game currently in development for the Playdate console.
Developed in Lua, dependencies include: Roomy - for ease of transitions between rooms and pause screens, and to more efficiently manage data as the game gets to be a bit larger. 

## A bit about me and this game
Hello! My name is Ingrid - I'm an aspiring game developer based in Washington, and this is my concept/execution of a game I'm choosing to tentatively call "Brewing." My concept for Brewing is a role-playing/sim game where you play as a character who's recently become the owner of their very own coffee shop! I'm hoping to implement a variety of game mechanics that allow you to carry out your daily duties as a barista/shop owner, as well as a friendship + romance xp system with the inhabitants of the town you've landed in. 
### Development milestones (thus far)
- Core player controls
- Fundamentals of game loop
  - This just means I've got the walking around and interacting with things in the game environment down (mostly)
- Entering/exiting game areas
- Art for player sprite
  -  Tilesets for main game areas and other spaces in progress
  -  Sprites for in game objects in progress
### In progress 
- More refined collision
- More refined player movement
- Basic dialogue system
- Basic inventory system
- And more!

### Can I play it?
Short answer: Not yet!

Long answer: I really hope so!! I'm aiming to have something working by the end of summer '25
